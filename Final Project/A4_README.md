    I procrastinated. Therefore, I did not do the 3D puzzle game. However, I did make a 2D isometric game in the space of 4-5 days (basically did a solo game jam).

    Doing the animations and figuring out how the movement will work on an isometric plane was the hardest part of the project. It took me 3 days to finish up the art assets, and rigging it in the animator in Unity. Figuring out how the boulder will drop and the arrows took me 2-3 hours at most (raycasting is fun, and is a lifesaver).  The remaining 2 days was basically me trying to put everything together. In hindsight, if I didn't solely focus on all of my exams, I may have been able to finish the whole game with a tutorial. But, it is what it is. I'll just finish this game on a different game engine during my spring/summer break.

    The enemies in this game are the boulders dropping on the player, arrows firing to the left of the player, arrows firing to the right of the player, and the crappy hitbox of isometric walls (trying to dodge arrows near the walls is hard, due to the jagginess of the wall). The pickups are the grimoire and the two spells that the player must "pick up" to restore the spells in their grimoire (Ignite and Shield).

    If I had managed my time wisely, supposedly, Twii (the character that the player controls - very cool wizard, crappy memory) wakes up in a  long dungeon corridor alone after messing up at a school-led excavation in a dangerous dungeon. When he is about to spell himself away from this dungeon, he realizes that he doesn't have his grimoire with him. Due to his crappy memory, he needs his grimoire with him at all times. So, as he ventures forth this long corridor, gaining flashbacks of what happened in the excavation that led to his ruin, he sees his supposedly-full-of-spells-and-notes grimoire is now a not-so-supposedly-full-spells-and-notes grimoire. When he goes and examines what happened to his was-beautiful-now-tattered grimoire, a trickster appears in front of him, his spells in his arms, and proceeds to run away further into the dungeon (hopefully not dropping his spells in random rooms of the dungeon, good heavens). And that's where the gameplay should begin.
