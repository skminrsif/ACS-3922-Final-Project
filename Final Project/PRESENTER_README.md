    Hello.

    **Notes:**

        If you want to have a better experience (in terms of lighting), please use the version in the with-lighting branch - however the game will be harder. Otherwise, use the version in the main branch. 

        How to move: WASD
        To use any spells (shield/ignite): Q
        To interact with your grimoires: E
        To change spells (when you have both shield and ignite): 1 for shield, 2 for ignite (use the numbers on top of the letters)

        After getting hit by an arrow, the character's hitbox will be inactive for a bit. So, if you were to interact with any of the objects, and there seems to be no feedback, that is normal. Wait for a few seconds, and try again. I'm not entirely sure how to use two box colliders for separate functions yet, which is why interactions after getting hit are weird.

        This also means that the shield is not properly working (it does not shield anything at all, due to collider issues - I'm still trying to find ways to solve this). 

        There is no game win/over screen, sadly.
        
        You have to be touching the torches to interact with it (press Q).

    **Supposedly synopsis** *(if you are interested)* **:** Twii (the character that the player controls - very cool wizard, crappy memory) wakes up in a  long dungeon corridor alone after messing up at a school-led excavation in a dangerous dungeon. When he is about to spell himself away from this dungeon, he realizes that he doesn't have his grimoire with him. Due to his crappy memory, he needs his grimoire with him at all times. So, as he ventures forth this long corridor, gaining flashbacks of what happened in the excavation that led to his ruin, he sees his supposedly-full-of-spells-and-notes grimoire is now a not-so-supposedly-full-spells-and-notes grimoire. When he goes and examines what happened to his was-beautiful-now-tattered grimoire, a trickster appears in front of him, his spells in his arms, and proceeds to run away further into the dungeon (hopefully not dropping his spells in random rooms of the dungeon, good heavens). And that's where the gameplay should begin.

    I hope you enjoy my game!
